# Project Description:
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model for real-time isolated sign language recognition in the PopSign smartphone app, making it more interactive and improving learning outcomes for users who want to learn American Sign Language (ASL) to communicate with deaf individuals. Our aim was to publish our approach on the respective Kaggle Competition.
